###Noteworthy risks, concerns, or problems
* Track season is picking up pace, and I can't let that dominate my life w.r.t. academics. Just school/running for a while, sorry ladies.
* Need to figure out how to properly send/return `Date` types via the API. I know this can be done, it just takes increased familiarity with JS's `Date` object.
* Need to understand and implement Mongoose Validation with API. Also, the Validator package will be used. I need to read some examples of express APIs using the `required` property on `PUT`s and `POST`s.  
* Move all the SDF stuff, hw, etc, into github wiki? That would make sense.  But I like pushing it all from CL. Maybe I can push to the wiki somehow.
