Proposal
Description:
        The basic premise for this (yet unnamed) web app is to serve as a singular hub for online journalism. I envision this web app to provide the functionality for three basics of journalistic endeavor: research, writing, and publication.
User: As a journalist, I want to research a topic so I can write informed articles.
User: As a journalist, I want a simple platform for my in-progress writing, so that my work can be saved and iterated on for my best product.
User: As a journalist, I want to my publication to look good, be rewarded, and perhaps be published anonymously, so I can express my researched opinion.
User: As a reader, I want to read interesting and well-formatted articles, and to reward my favorite pieces so I can continue to be informed and/or entertained.
With my current understanding of the relevant tech, I feel I could build out the web application described (loosely) above. My goal is to take this all a step further and provide as secure an experience as possible to protect the identities of the app’s users.
 
Motivation: 
        I have a couple of friends that pursued various types of Journalism as undergraduates and some of those people have gone on to write professionally or on the side. I was speaking to my journalist friends last fall following the ISIS executions of Sotloff and Foley about the dangers of their chosen field. In discussing the need for more simple and secure tools for journalists, the idea for this project developed.
        I think that’s it’s the role of software developers to build tools that give users the gift of abstraction. Tools already exist that provide (more) secure research, communication, and publication online (and some will surely be plugged in to this project via their APIs), but I’d like to attempt an app that provides this “under one roof.”
Lastly, larger motivations aside, being able to develop a modern web app is a skill in high demand. Building my understanding of the relevant technologies and techniques will be instructive regardless if the finished product is adopted for its more ambition intentions.
